# RabbleWabble
This is a language learning application tailored especially for Japanese. I created it to have a template regarding the implementation details of commonly used design patterns, namely:
* Singleton
* Strategy
* Memento
* Delegate
* Observer
* Builder
## Roadmap
- [x] ~~Implement user scores tracking
- [x] ~~Implement question groups editing
- [ ] Implement a spaced repetition algorithm
## Requirements

* Xcode 11
## Credits
I built this application by following the [Design Patterns by Tutorials book](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/design-patterns-by-tutorials/v3.0#ratings-count-hook) by Raywenderlich
